# Installation

### Operating System

Currently, this project runs on ROS Lunar. Official packages are only provided for
Ubuntu 16.04 and Debian Stretch. While you can theoretically build and run ROS on
any Linux distribution, these are by far the easiest to setup.

### ROS

To install ROS Lunar on Ubuntu, refer to the
[Lunar Install Instructions](http://wiki.ros.org/lunar/Installation/Ubuntu)

Many of the packages in the full installation are uneeded. The `ros-lunar-desktop`
package is more than sufficient.
